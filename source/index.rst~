Intelligent agents in Distributed Systems
================================================

Multi-Agents 
============
Multi-agent systems are systems composed by a number of agents interacting through an environment. Therefore it covers anything from computer interacting in a network to the financial market. Here we will try to focus on the distributed aspect of those systems and also it's applications in Computer Science.

Now that we know what is a Multi-Agent System (MAS) we need to explain what an agent is. An agent have the following properties:
    * It have some degree of autonomy
    * It must be decentralized
    * It have a limited view/understanding of the world (local view)
    * It might be purposeful
        * If an agent doesn't seek a goal we call it a passive agent
        * If the agent have a goal we call it an active agent
            * Active agents can be clustered as rationals if they always act optimally or irrationals if they don't. 
            * A purposeful agent might follow simple reasoning rules or complex reasoning calculations, or even be behavioral (act in a more natural way)

There is a concept that have a considerable intersection with MAS that is Agent-Based Models (ABM). ABM's are models of systems involving many agents, usually those agents follow simple rules (following the KISS rule, Keep It Simple Stupid!).
